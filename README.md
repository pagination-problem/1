This repository contains all the supplementary material accompanying the paper [_Algorithms for the Bin Packing Problem with Overlapping Items_](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00558) (A. Grange, I. Kacem and S. Martin, 2016, submitted to [IJOC](http://pubsonline.informs.org)). It comprises:

- This document (`README.md`).
- The MIT License (`LICENSE`).
- A dataset of 10986 random instances distributed in 1831 JSON files (directory `gauss`).
- Our numerical analysis of this dataset (`analysis.ipynb`). This so-called Jupyter Notebook is self-contained and interactive. Reevaluating its cells, testing another ideas or carrying out your own experiments may require some installations on your machine. We recommend using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

The whole repository can either be retrieved as a zipped archive <kbd>Download ZIP</kbd>, or cloned on your computer if you intend to keep it up to date without downloading the whole thing each time and writing over your own changes.
